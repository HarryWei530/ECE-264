# ECE-264: Data Structures & Algorithms I

## Project 1: Stacks and Queues
A program and its associated files that take a file input to create stacks and queues, and push and pop values from these data structures.  These data structures were implemented through a created SimpleList class that demonstrated the core tenets of object oriented programming, abstraction, inheritence, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

## Project 2: Sorting Algorithms
A challenge program to sort a set of values as fast as possible.  An input file is specified that has four columns each of which has a different value, the first being a set of numbers that are mostly sorted, the second being a randomly generated 32-bit integer, the third being a randomly generated ASCII character (33-126), and the last being a randomly generated string of length 25.  Obtaining the data and inserting it into a linked list is done by the provided code for the program, but the sorts used are the challenge.  Sorts used are insertion sort, LSD radix sort, LSD radix sort, and MSD radix sort with an insertion sort for each of the respective columns.
